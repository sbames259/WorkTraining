Loops
   
    For Loop
    
    const students = ['Jane', 'Caleb', 'John', 'Frank', JoAnna', 'Kerri']

    function welcomeStudents(studentlist) {
        for (
            let i = 0; //The 'start' index. This sets a variable i to 0
            i < studentList.length; // the condition for continuing
            i++ //incrementer for the index variable, i++ says to increment i by 1 each iteration
        )
        {console.log('Welcome, ${studentList[i]})}
    }

    forEach Loop
        takes in a function and applies it to every object in an array.

    
    forIn Loop
        allows access to the property and the property keys of an object.


    mapLoop
        USE THIS!! similar to for loop, but is immutabile (doesn't overwrite original array)
