Values you pass to a function are called parameters

You can cross-reference other files in JS

Default Parameters:

    Ask for required parameters first in a function and then do default parameters.


Returns:

    Anything in a function after a return will not execute, return is the end of the line.



String literal:

    function helloName(name = 'Bill'){
        return 'Hello, ${name}
    }

    ${name} is a string literal and allows me to drop the variable right into the string.


If/Else Statements:

    Check the largest value first, then move down (ages: senior, adult, teenager, child)

Conditional Operators:

    = sets a value to a variable
    == evaluates the value only and not the type
    === evaluates the value AND data type (use this most often in JS)

    != not equal, opposite of ==
    !=== not equal, opposite of ===

    && AND condition (must meet ALL conditions specified by AND)

    || OR condition (must meet at least ONE condition specified by OR)

    * the ! sign means not, can be placed in front of a variable to make it opposite (not)

Ternary:
    
    let age = 16
    Let x = age >= 18
        ? 'adult'
        : 'child'
    ? means true
    : means false
